# Inspiration
We wanted to build an app that makes visitor sign in and information collection a breeze. Visitor sign in at buildings today is a pain, and most information is stored on paper.

# What it does
We built an Amazon Echo skill that interacts with visitors in order to send to sign in. The app collects their name and records their time of sign in and sign out in a database. Echo easily interacts with users and also has an SMS Chatbot that users can text with instead of speaking to the Echo.

# How we built it
We built our app using Amazon Developer Services for Alexa. In addition, we used Node.js along with Twilio to create the messaging service and the admin security dashboard.

# Challenges we ran into
Amazon Web Services was tricky to use and we had trouble creating intents to interact with Alexa. In addition we had problems with the Bluetooth Beacons and tracking visitor location.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We built an Amazon Alexa platform to interact with the visitors and an SMS Chatbot to get visitor information.

# What we learned
We learned a lot about coding with Alexa and Python and how to display user information in a meaningful dashboard.

# What's next for Vizitr
We want to successfully build the bluetooth platform tracker so security will be able to locate visitors at any time.
